\title{sfarc.node: Create Lines from Shared Boundaries}
\description{
Create lines from shared boundaries between polygons. A single copy of a shared boundary is 
 created as 'sf' lines, keeping the row identity of the input polygon/s. It's expected that polygons have
 clean neighbour boundaries and don't overlap.
